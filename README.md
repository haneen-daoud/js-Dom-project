# Landing Page Project

## Project Description
This project demonstrates the manipulation of the DOM using JavaScript. It dynamically builds a navigation menu based on the sections present in the HTML. As you scroll through the page, the section in the viewport is highlighted, and the corresponding navigation item is also highlighted. Additionally, a "scroll to top" button appears when the user scrolls down, allowing them to quickly return to the top of the page.
